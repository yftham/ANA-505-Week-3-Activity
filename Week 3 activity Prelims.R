#This brings the 'women' data into my environment from Base R (Run this)
women

#This code saves the women data as a dataframe with a new name
#TASK: Save the women dataset with a new name
NewWomen<-women

#This code chunk allows me to see the top 2 rows of my data
#TASK: Write the function that returns the top rows
head(NewWomen,2)

#This code chunk shows me the internal structure 
#Task: Write the function that shows the number of rows, columns, column names, class of columns

#This code chunk shows me some basic summary stats
#Such as Min, Max, Mean. Quartiles...
#Task: Write the function that gives summary stats

#This allows me to apply the function to just one certain column
#Task: Write the function to return the Mean of just the height column

#This allows me to save one column as its own object ('values' in the Environment)

#and write the function to create an object for just the Height column 
#(these should show as values in the environment window, not as datasets)

#This takes the individual objects ('values' in the Environment) and creates a dataframe

HeightandWeight<-data.frame(OnlyHeight,OnlyWeight)

#This code chunk creates a subset from my dataset
#Note that the subset only appears in the Console (not the Environment)
#Task: Write the function to create a subset of the data where the height is > 65
#If I wanted to save the subset, I would need to name it as done in the code above

#This shows me how many rows are in my dataset and
#TASK: Write the function that returns the number of rows

#This shows me how many columns are in my dataset

#This code will install the ggplot2 package
#TASK: Write the function that installs the ggplot2 package

#This code calls the ggplot2 package so I can use its functions
#Task: Write the function that 'calls' the ggplot2 package

#This produces a scatter plot of the height and weight columns
#Task: replace the dataset name and column names in the plot function below 
#to produce a scatter plot of height and weight
